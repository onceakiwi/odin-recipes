    <p>The ultimate transformation of leftover bread, my Aunt Jo's Bread and Butter Pudding is golden and buttery, and custardy inside.</p>

        <li>8 heaped cups white bread, preferably slightly stale, cut into 2.5 cm / 1" cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup sultanas or raisins (or more!)</li>
        <h3>Egg Mixture</h3>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups milk (low or full fat, not zero fat)</li> 
        <li>1 cup heavy / thickened cream (or any other cream)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp / 40g unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp cinnamon powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>   
        <h3>Finishes / Serving:</h3>
        <li>30g / 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted - for top pre baking</li>
        <li>20g / 1 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted - for brushing post baking (optional)</li>   
        <li>Icing sugar / powdered sugar, for dusting</li>
        <li>Ice cream, cream, custard, chocolate sauce, caramel sauce, etc</li> 
        <li>4 dried red chilies esp goondu milagai variety</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ol class="list2">
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types)</li>
        <li>Place eggs in a large bowl, whisk briefly. Add remaining Egg Mixture ingredients and whisk.</li>
        <li>Add bread and sultanas, briefly mix, then set aside for 3 minutes to allow egg mixture to soak through the bread.</li>
        <li>Pour into a baking dish (10 cup / 2.5 litre / 2.5 quart). If you have lots of sultanas on the surface, poke them below the surface.</li>
        <li>Drizzle over melted butter, then bake for 25 - 30 minutes or until golden on top and the inside is set but still slightly wobbly (poke to check).</li>
        <li>Brush with remaining 1 1/2 tbsp melted butter (optional), then dust with icing sugar.</li>
        <li>Serve - rest for a few ninutes, then serve immediately, with toppings of choice! My favourites are ice cream, custard and cream.</li>
